# Git Rules

- Commit messages in English
- All documentation, comments, and code in English
- Never commit secrets.yaml or *.db files
- One commit = one logical change
- Never use `--no-verify` to skip pre-commit hooks
- Never push directly to main, always create a PR
- Use maoku-family account for all git operations (not Microsoft account)
