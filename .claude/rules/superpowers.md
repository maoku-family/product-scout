# Superpowers Workflow

Always follow the superpowers skill pipeline:

1. **Before implementation**: Use `superpowers:brainstorming` for new features
2. **Planning**: Use `superpowers:writing-plans` to create detailed execution plans
3. **Execution**: Use `superpowers:executing-plans` to execute in batches with checkpoints
   - Within each task, use `superpowers:test-driven-development` - write tests first, then implementation
   - When encountering bugs or test failures, use `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
4. **Completion**: Use `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` to verify and merge/PR
5. **After milestones**: Update Notion documentation (design doc + architecture doc)

Never skip steps. Always announce which skill you are using.
